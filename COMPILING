COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR SATABS
-----------------------------------

1. SatAbs relies on infrastructure provided by CBMC. As first step,
   obtain the source code of CBMC release 4.3 as follows:

   svn co http://www.cprover.org/svn/cbmc/releases/cbmc-4.3


2. Follow the configuration and compilation instructions provided
   with CBMC. SatAbs won't compile unless you first compile CBMC.

3. Then adjust src/config.inc to point to the location of CBMC.

4. Do (cd src; make) -- that should do it.
